# Phoenix Biodiversity Intactness Index From 2017 to 2020

## About
This repository contains a notebook investigating the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) in the Phoenix area. The aim of this repository is to understand the changes in biodiversity levels from 2017 to 2020, focusing on areas with significant ecological shifts.

## Visualization
The project's final visual shows areas in the Phoenix subdivision with a significant change in BII levels from 2017 to 2020 using a significance level of 0.75. 

## Highlights
- Using `io-biodiversity` from the STAC server in the Microsoft Planetary Computer
- Analyzing temporal and spatial biodiversity data using `rioxarray` and `geopandas`
- Examining biodiversity changes over time using temporal data manipulation
- Classification matrix implementation
